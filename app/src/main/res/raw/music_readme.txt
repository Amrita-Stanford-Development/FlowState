Add your .mp3 music files here.
The file name (without .mp3 extension) will be displayed as the song name in the app.

Example:
- lofi_beats.mp3 will show as "Lofi Beats" in the app
- study_music.mp3 will show as "Study Music" in the app

Note: File names must be lowercase with underscores only (no spaces or special characters).
